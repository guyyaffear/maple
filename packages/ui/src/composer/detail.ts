/**
 * `Maple.Detail`: everything about this comment that a row has no room for.
 *
 * The island's rows are scanned, so they carry two words and a tooltip. The
 * panel is read, so it carries the sentence: who wrote it and how much that is
 * worth, where it is in its life, and — in developer detail — which rung found
 * it again, how sure that is, the source line and the CSS path. Those four used
 * to sit in the row as grey footnotes, where they were noise over the one thing
 * a row is for.
